# Getting Started

First, drag this link your bookmarks bar - [ðŸ”— View in Juncture](javascript:(function()%7Bwindow.location.href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fjuncture-digital.io%3Fgithub%3D%22%2Bdocument.URL%7D)()%3B)

This makes it convenient to view any GitHub hosted Markdown file as Juncture-enabled web page.  Then, when you're on a GitHub page you can simply click the bookmark to view a Juncture-rendered version of the page.  This makes it easy to preview edits (after committing) when authoring a new page.
