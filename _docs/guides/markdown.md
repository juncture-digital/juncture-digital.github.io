# ✍️ What Is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a lightweight way to format plain text so it looks good when viewed as a web page or document. It’s simple, readable, and widely used for writing content online.

With just a few easy symbols, you can:
- Create headings, bold text, and lists
- Add links and images
- Write clean, readable content that’s easy to maintain

# 🧪 Markdown in Action

Here’s how Markdown compares to what you see on the page:

| Task            | Markdown Syntax            | Result                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Heading         | `# My Title`               | **My Title**             |
| Bold text       | `**bold**`                 | **bold**                 |
| Link            | `[Google](https://google.com)` | [Google](https://google.com) |
| List item       | `- Item`                   | – Item                   |

It’s that easy!

# 💡 Why Juncture Uses Markdown

**Juncture** builds on Markdown to make creating content even more powerful. Instead of learning HTML or JavaScript, you write in Markdown—and Juncture interprets your content and turns it into a modern, interactive web page.

You can even add components like interactive maps, image viewers, audio players, and more—all using extended Markdown tags like:

```
`map location=32.051,-81.104,8 caption="Savannah, GA" marker`
```

That’s much simpler than embedding code manually.

With Markdown as the foundation:
- Your content stays easy to read and update
- You can focus on *what* you’re saying, not *how* it looks
