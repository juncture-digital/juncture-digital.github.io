# Getting Started

This Getting Started guide defines two ways in which Juncture can be used.  In the first approach, the Quick Start, any GitHub-hosted Markdown file can be used to create an interactive web page.  The Website Publishing guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a fully-functional Juncture-powered website.

## Quick Start

The [Quick Start] Guide shows how a Markdown file located in any public Github repository can be used to generate a Juncture-powered web page.  This is the simplest possible method for using Juncture.  It does not require the template cloning, Github Pages activation and configuration steps needed for website publishing.  In the Quick Start Guide a simple web page is created with an interactive image that is loaded from the Wikimedia Commons file hosting service.
