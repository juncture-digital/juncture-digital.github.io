# 🧱 What Is Jekyll?

**Jekyll** is a tool that turns plain text into websites. It’s a **static site generator**, which means it takes Markdown files (like `index.md`) and transforms them into web pages with HTML and CSS.

Jekyll is often used with **GitHub Pages**, and it’s built into GitHub’s system. You don’t need to install anything—just write your content, and GitHub + Jekyll take care of the rest.

# 🛠️ How Jekyll Works

Here’s what Jekyll does behind the scenes:

1. **Reads your Markdown files** (like `about.md` or `index.md`)
2. **Applies a layout or template** to give them a consistent style
3. **Generates HTML pages** that can be viewed in a browser

Everything is static and fast—no databases or server scripting needed.

# 📦 Jekyll + Juncture: A Perfect Match

When you use **Juncture** for building sites, Jekyll does the background work of turning your Markdown into a full website.

Juncture:
- Adds powerful interactive features (maps, videos, etc.)
- Uses Markdown-enhanced tags (`map`, `image`, etc.)

Jekyll:
- Turns your Markdown + Juncture tags into a working site
- Handles the navigation, layout, and page rendering

You focus on content. Jekyll + Juncture take care of everything else.
