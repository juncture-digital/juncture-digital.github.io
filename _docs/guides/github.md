# üêô What Is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a platform for storing, sharing, and collaborating on code and content. At its core, it‚Äôs a place where you can create and manage files‚Äîespecially text-based files like Markdown and code‚Äîusing a system called **Git**.

Think of GitHub as a kind of cloud-based filing cabinet that:
- Keeps track of every change you make
- Lets you go back to earlier versions
- Makes it easy to collaborate with others
- Can be used to publish and host websites

# üåç Using GitHub with Juncture

**Juncture** uses GitHub not just to manage files‚Äîbut also to **publish live websites**. Here‚Äôs how it works:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository
A **repository** is like a folder on GitHub. It contains your website files: Markdown pages, images, and other assets.

You can create one for free at [github.com](https://github.com).

## 2. Write Your Content in Markdown
With Juncture, you write your pages in simple Markdown format. Each page becomes a webpage.

For example, a file called `index.md` becomes your homepage.

## 3. Add Juncture Tags
Inside your Markdown files, you can use Juncture‚Äôs custom tags (like `` `map` ``, `` `image` ``, etc.) to embed interactive content.

## 4. Publish Using GitHub Pages
GitHub can automatically turn your repository into a working website using a feature called **GitHub Pages**.

This means:
- **No server needed**
- **No special software**
- Your Markdown + Juncture tags = a full-featured site

Juncture is designed to work seamlessly with GitHub Pages, making it easy for anyone to build beautiful, interactive web pages using just a web browser.
